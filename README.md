## Hi there 👋

<!--
**mkchank3210/mkchank3210** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on advancing my knowledge base.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning understanding how to use Gits and GitHub.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with nothing right now.  I don't know what I don't know.
- 💬 Ask me about my time in the Marine Corps.... it's SUUPER boring.
- 📫 How to reach me: turn around, if I'm not there check your closet.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learned computer programming with C++ 24 years ago, I don't think Gits existed back then ('96-'00)
