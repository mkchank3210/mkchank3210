## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on advancing my knowledge base.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning understanding how to use Gits and GitHub.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing right now.  I don't know what I don't know.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my time in the Marine Corps.... it's SUUPER boring.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: turn around, if I'm not there check your closet.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned computer programming with C++ 24 years ago, I don't think git existed back then ('96-'00)
